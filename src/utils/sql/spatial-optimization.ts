// Spatial Complexity Optimization Module
// This module provides optimized spatial functions and indexes to solve O(nÂ²) CROSS JOIN performance issues
// Expected Performance Gains:
// - 80-90% reduction in expensive spatial calculations
// - 10-50x faster spatial queries with proper indexing
// - 95%+ reduction in cross-join comparisons
