ACTUAL MESA TRAIL TOPOLOGY
==========================

We have a CHAIN of Mesa Trail segments that should be merged into one continuous edge:

Vertex 9 (degree 3) ← Edge 9: Mesa Trail (9 → 11) [0.68km]
     ↓
Vertex 11 (degree 3) ← Edge 25: Mesa Trail (11 → 14) [0.91km]  
     ↓
Vertex 14 (degree 3) ← Edge 2: Mesa Trail (14 → 1) [1.91km]
     ↓
Vertex 1 (degree 2)

PLUS at Vertex 14, there's an intersecting trail:
Edge 5: Mesa (14 → 38) [0.09km] → Vertex 38 (degree 1)

THE PROBLEM:
============
The degree-2 merging logic expects each vertex in a chain to have exactly 2 edges.
But our Mesa Trail chain goes through vertices with degree 3:
- Vertex 9: degree 3 (connects to other trails besides Mesa Trail)
- Vertex 11: degree 3 (connects to other trails besides Mesa Trail)  
- Vertex 14: degree 3 (connects to Mesa Trail + "Mesa" connector)

So the merging logic fails and leaves the Mesa Trail split into 3 separate edges:
- Edge 9: Mesa Trail (9 → 11) [0.68km]
- Edge 25: Mesa Trail (11 → 14) [0.91km] 
- Edge 2: Mesa Trail (14 → 1) [1.91km]

INSTEAD OF one continuous edge:
- Edge: Mesa Trail (9 → 1) [3.5km total]

THE SOLUTION:
=============
We need to modify the degree-2 merging to:
1. Identify chains of edges with the same trail name
2. Allow merging through degree-3+ vertices if the trails form a continuous path
3. Merge Edge 9 + Edge 25 + Edge 2 into one long Mesa Trail edge
