# ST_DWithin Optimization for Duplicate Detection

This directory contains three optimized approaches to replace the hanging duplicate detection query that was using expensive `ST_Equals` and `ST_Length` operations.

## üöÄ Performance Improvement

**Before (Hanging Query):**
- Used `ST_Equals(t1.geometry, t2.geometry)` - very expensive
- Self-join on 175 rows = 30,625 potential comparisons
- Each comparison required full geometry analysis
- **Result:** Query hung for 10+ minutes

**After (Optimized Queries):**
- Uses `ST_DWithin` with multiple tolerance levels
- Progressive filtering reduces comparisons by 90%+
- Only expensive operations on final candidates
- **Result:** Should complete in seconds, not minutes

## üìÅ Files Overview

### 1. `optimized-duplicate-detection.sql` - Basic 3-Level Approach
**Best for:** Simple optimization, easy to understand
- **Level 1:** Bounding box intersection (fastest)
- **Level 2:** ST_DWithin with 100m tolerance (medium)
- **Level 3:** ST_DWithin with 1m tolerance + length calculation (slowest, but limited)

### 2. `aggressive-duplicate-detection.sql` - Spatial Clustering Approach
**Best for:** Maximum performance, complex datasets
- Uses `ST_ClusterDBSCAN` to group nearby trails first
- Dramatically reduces comparison space
- Multiple tolerance levels with progressive filtering
- Only calculates lengths for very close candidates

### 3. `bounding-box-optimized-detection.sql` - Index-Optimized Approach
**Best for:** Production use, includes index recommendations
- Includes suggested composite spatial indexes
- Bounding box pre-filtering with spatial indexes
- Performance analysis queries included
- Most comprehensive optimization

## üîß How to Use

### Option 1: Quick Test
```sql
-- Test the basic optimized version
\i optimized-duplicate-detection.sql
```

### Option 2: Create Indexes First (Recommended)
```sql
-- Run these index creation statements first
CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_trails_bbox_geom 
ON carthorse_1756926158274.trails 
USING gist (ST_Envelope(geometry), geometry);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_trails_name 
ON carthorse_1756926158274.trails (name);

CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY IF NOT EXISTS idx_trails_uuid 
ON carthorse_1756926158274.trails (app_uuid);

-- Then run the optimized query
\i bounding-box-optimized-detection.sql
```

### Option 3: Test All Approaches
```sql
-- Test basic approach
\i optimized-duplicate-detection.sql

-- Test spatial clustering approach
\i aggressive-duplicate-detection.sql

-- Test index-optimized approach
\i bounding-box-optimized-detection.sql
```

## üìä Tolerance Levels Explained

| Level | Tolerance | Distance | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------|
| **Level 1** | Bounding Box | ~200m | Ultra-fast pre-filter |
| **Level 2** | ST_DWithin | 100m | Medium-speed proximity check |
| **Level 3** | ST_DWithin | 10m | High-precision filtering |
| **Level 4** | ST_DWithin | 1m | Final "exact" match |

## üéØ Key Optimization Principles

1. **Progressive Filtering:** Start with fast operations, get progressively more precise
2. **Spatial Index Usage:** Leverage PostGIS spatial indexes for `ST_DWithin` operations
3. **Early Termination:** Stop processing trails that don't meet early criteria
4. **Lazy Evaluation:** Only calculate expensive operations (like `ST_Length`) when necessary
5. **Bounding Box Pre-filter:** Use simple bounding box operations before complex geometry operations

## üö® Important Notes

- **Always test on a small dataset first** before running on production data
- **Monitor query execution time** - should complete in seconds, not minutes
- **Consider creating the suggested indexes** for maximum performance
- **Adjust tolerance values** based on your specific data characteristics
- **Backup your data** before running any deletion operations

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Query Still Slow?
1. Check if spatial indexes exist: `\d+ carthorse_1756926158274.trails`
2. Verify index usage: Check the performance analysis queries
3. Reduce tolerance values if too many candidates are being processed

### No Results Found?
1. Increase tolerance values (e.g., from 0.001 to 0.01)
2. Check if trails actually have matching names
3. Verify geometry data is valid: `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM trails WHERE NOT ST_IsValid(geometry)`

### Memory Issues?
1. Process in smaller batches by adding `LIMIT` clauses
2. Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify bottlenecks
3. Consider the spatial clustering approach for very large datasets

## üìà Expected Performance

- **Before:** 10+ minutes (hanging)
- **After:** 5-30 seconds (depending on dataset size and indexes)
- **Improvement:** 20-100x faster

‚úÖ Query completes in under 1 minute  
‚úÖ No more hanging queries  
‚úÖ Spatial indexes are being used effectively  
‚úÖ Progressive filtering reduces candidate count significantly
