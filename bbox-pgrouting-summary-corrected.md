## pgRouting Status

### ✅ What Works:
- **Network Creation:** Successfully created pgRouting views
- **Node Mapping:** 154 nodes properly mapped from UUID to integer IDs
- **Edge Mapping:** 96 edges properly mapped (was 85)
- **Geometry Processing:** All geometries properly converted for pgRouting
- **Complete Coverage:** Now includes all trails that intersect the bbox

### ⚠️ Issues Found:
- **pgRouting Function:** `pgr_ksp` function signature issue (needs parameter type specification)
- **Route Testing:** Could not complete route finding due to function signature

## Network Quality - IMPROVED!

### ✅ Strengths:
- **Complete Coverage:** 60km of trails in 26km² area (+8km)
- **Dense Network:** 154 nodes with 96 edges (+11 edges)
- **Varied Terrain:** Mix of flat paths (Boulder Creek) and steep trails (Saddle Rock)
- **Intersection Points:** 21 intersection nodes for route planning
- **Better Connectivity:** Includes boundary-crossing trails

### 📊 Network Density (Updated):
- **Nodes per km²:** 5.9 nodes/km²
- **Trails per km²:** 3.7 trails/km² (+0.4)
- **Average trail length:** 0.63km (good for short hikes)
- **Total trail density:** 2.3 km/km² (+0.3)

## What Was Fixed

### 🚨 **Problem Identified:**
The original analysis was **too restrictive** - it only included trails where **BOTH endpoints** were within the bbox, excluding:
- Trails that start inside bbox, end outside
- Trails that start outside bbox, end inside  
- Trails that cross through the bbox but have endpoints outside

### 🔧 **Solution Applied:**
Changed from endpoint-based filtering to **geometry intersection**:
```sql
-- OLD (restrictive): Both endpoints must be in bbox
WHERE n1.lng BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND n1.lat BETWEEN $3 AND $4
  AND n2.lng BETWEEN $1 AND $2 AND n2.lat BETWEEN $3 AND $4

-- NEW (complete): Any trail that intersects the bbox
WHERE ST_Intersects(e.geometry, ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON(...)', 4326))
```

### 📈 **Results:**
- **+11 trails** included (96 vs 85)
- **+8.13km** total length (60.18km vs 52.05km)
- **Better connectivity** for routing
- **Complete network** representation

## Visualization

The analysis generated `bbox-pgrouting-analysis.geojson` with:
- **Red outline:** Bbox boundary
- **Yellow points:** Endpoint nodes (133)
- **Green points:** Intersection nodes (21) 
- **Blue lines:** Trail segments (96 - now complete!)

## Next Steps

1. **Fix pgRouting Function:** Update function call to specify parameter types
2. **Route Testing:** Test actual route finding between intersection nodes
3. **Performance Analysis:** Measure routing performance for this dense network
4. **Route Recommendations:** Generate sample routes for different distances/elevations

## Conclusion

The bbox now contains a **complete, well-connected trail network** perfect for pgRouting analysis:
- ✅ **154 nodes** provide many routing options
- ✅ **96 trails** offer diverse route possibilities  
- ✅ **21 intersections** enable complex route planning
- ✅ **60km total length** supports various hike distances
- ✅ **Mixed terrain** (flat to steep) supports different fitness levels
- ✅ **Complete coverage** includes all intersecting trails

This area is ideal for testing the orthogonal pgRouting implementation with a **complete network**! 🎯
