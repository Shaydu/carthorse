# Missing Trails, Edges, and Nodes Analysis

## üö® **Problem Identified: Bbox Filtering Issue**

### **The Issue:**
The bbox analysis is **too restrictive** - it only includes trails where **BOTH endpoints** are within the bbox. This excludes trails that:
- Start inside bbox, end outside
- Start outside bbox, end inside  
- Cross through the bbox but have endpoints outside

### **Numbers:**
- **Total trails in staging:** 96
- **Trails with both endpoints in bbox:** 85
- **Missing trails:** 11 (11.5% of total)

## üó∫Ô∏è **Missing Trails Analysis**

### **Trails Excluded by Bbox Filter:**

1. **Boulder Creek Path** (0.12km) - Extends outside bbox
2. **Mallory Cave Trail** (1.23km) - Crosses bbox boundary
3. **Sacred Cliffs** (0.32km) - Partially outside bbox
4. **Green Mountain West Ridge Trail** (1.68km) - Crosses bbox
5. **Red Rocks Spur Trail** (0.45km) - Extends outside bbox
6. **N.C.A.R. - Bear Connector** (0.87km) - Crosses boundary
7. **Green Bear Trail** (1.14km) - Crosses bbox
8. **Sacred Cliffs** (0.99km) - Partially outside
9. **Mesa Trail** (0.57km) - Crosses boundary
10. **Red Rocks Spur Trail** (0.34km) - Extends outside

### **Impact on Network:**
- **Missing connectivity:** Trails that cross bbox boundaries
- **Incomplete network:** Important connector trails excluded
- **Reduced routing options:** Fewer paths between areas

## üîß **Solutions**

### **Option 1: Expand Bbox Analysis**
```sql
-- Include trails that intersect the bbox (not just endpoints)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_edges e
JOIN staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_nodes n1 ON e.source = n1.id
JOIN staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_nodes n2 ON e.target = n2.id
WHERE ST_Intersects(e.geometry, ST_MakeEnvelope(-105.32047300758535, 39.97645469545003, -105.26687332281577, 40.01589890417776, 4326));
```

### **Option 2: Use Geometry Intersection**
```sql
-- Include any trail that intersects the bbox polygon
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_edges e
WHERE ST_Intersects(e.geometry, ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-105.32047300758535 39.97645469545003, -105.32047300758535 40.01589890417776, -105.26687332281577 40.01589890417776, -105.26687332281577 39.97645469545003, -105.32047300758535 39.97645469545003))', 4326));
```

### **Option 3: Include Boundary Trails**
```sql
-- Include trails where at least one endpoint is in bbox
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_edges e
JOIN staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_nodes n1 ON e.source = n1.id
JOIN staging_boulder_1754308823746.routing_nodes n2 ON e.target = n2.id
WHERE (n1.lng BETWEEN -105.32047300758535 AND -105.26687332281577 AND n1.lat BETWEEN 39.97645469545003 AND 40.01589890417776)
   OR (n2.lng BETWEEN -105.32047300758535 AND -105.26687332281577 AND n2.lat BETWEEN 39.97645469545003 AND 40.01589890417776);
```

## üìä **Recommended Approach**

### **Use Geometry Intersection (Option 2):**
- **Pros:** Most accurate, includes all trails that pass through bbox
- **Cons:** May include very short segments of long trails
- **Result:** Would include all 96 trails that intersect the bbox

### **Implementation:**
```javascript
// Update the bbox analysis to use geometry intersection
const edgesResult = await pgClient.query(`
  SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as total_edges,
    COUNT(DISTINCT trail_id) as unique_trails,
    AVG(length_km) as avg_length_km,
    SUM(length_km) as total_length_km
  FROM ${stagingSchema}.routing_edges e
  WHERE ST_Intersects(e.geometry, ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON((-105.32047300758535 39.97645469545003, -105.32047300758535 40.01589890417776, -105.26687332281577 40.01589890417776, -105.26687332281577 39.97645469545003, -105.32047300758535 39.97645469545003))', 4326))
`);
```

## üéØ **Expected Results with Fix:**

### **Current (Restrictive):**
- **Edges:** 85 trails
- **Nodes:** 154 nodes
- **Total length:** 52.05 km

### **With Geometry Intersection:**
- **Edges:** 96 trails (+11)
- **Nodes:** ~170+ nodes (+16+)
- **Total length:** ~60+ km (+8+ km)
- **Better connectivity:** More routing options

## üöÄ **Next Steps:**

1. **Update bbox analysis** to use geometry intersection
2. **Re-run analysis** with corrected filtering
3. **Test pgRouting** with complete network
4. **Generate updated visualization** with all trails

This will give you a much more complete and useful trail network for pgRouting analysis! üéØ
