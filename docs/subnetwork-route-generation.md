# Subnetwork-Based Route Generation

## Overview

The subnetwork-based route generation feature addresses memory issues that occur when processing large trail networks. Instead of processing the entire network at once, it detects disconnected subnetworks and processes each one individually, significantly reducing memory usage and improving stability.

## Problem Solved

### Memory Issues with Large Networks
- **Traditional approach**: Processes entire network in memory simultaneously
- **Result**: Memory exhaustion, crashes, and unstable performance
- **Impact**: Unable to process large regions or complex trail networks

### Subnetwork Solution
- **New approach**: Detects and processes disconnected subnetworks one at a time
- **Result**: Stable memory usage, no crashes, scalable to large networks
- **Benefits**: Better error isolation, easier debugging, predictable performance

## How It Works

### 1. Subnetwork Detection
The system uses pgRouting's `pgr_connectedComponents` to identify disconnected subnetworks:

```sql
SELECT component, COUNT(*) as node_count
FROM pgr_connectedComponents(
  'SELECT id, source, target, length_km as cost FROM staging.ways_noded'
)
GROUP BY component
ORDER BY node_count DESC
```

### 2. Subnetwork Processing
Each subnetwork is processed independently:
- Creates temporary views for the subnetwork's nodes and edges
- Generates routes using simplified algorithms
- Cleans up temporary resources after processing
- Moves to the next subnetwork

### 3. Memory Management
- **Sequential processing**: One subnetwork at a time (default)
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple subnetworks simultaneously (optional)
- **Memory monitoring**: Tracks memory usage per subnetwork
- **Garbage collection**: Automatic cleanup between subnetworks

## Usage

### CLI Command

Enable subnetwork-based route generation with the `--use-subnetworks` flag:

```bash
npx ts-node src/cli/export.ts \
  --region boulder \
  --out /path/to/output.geojson \
  --format geojson \
  --use-subnetworks \
  --max-subnetwork-size 1000 \
  --min-subnetwork-size 3 \
  --max-routes-per-subnetwork 10
```

### Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `--use-subnetworks` | Enable subnetwork-based route generation | `false` |
| `--max-subnetwork-size` | Maximum subnetwork size to process (nodes) | `1000` |
| `--min-subnetwork-size` | Minimum subnetwork size to process (nodes) | `3` |
| `--max-routes-per-subnetwork` | Maximum routes per subnetwork | `10` |

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { SubnetworkRouteGeneratorService } from './src/utils/services/subnetwork-route-generator-service';

const subnetworkGenerator = new SubnetworkRouteGeneratorService(pgClient, {
  stagingSchema: 'staging_schema',
  maxSubnetworkSize: 1000,
  minSubnetworkSize: 3,
  maxRoutesPerSubnetwork: 10,
  enableMemoryMonitoring: true,
  parallelProcessing: false
});

const routes = await subnetworkGenerator.generateRoutesForAllSubnetworks(patterns);
```

## Configuration

### Subnetwork Size Limits

**Recommended settings for different network sizes:**

| Network Size | Max Subnetwork Size | Min Subnetwork Size | Max Routes/Subnetwork |
|--------------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------------|
| Small (< 1000 nodes) | 500 | 3 | 15 |
| Medium (1000-5000 nodes) | 1000 | 5 | 10 |
| Large (> 5000 nodes) | 2000 | 10 | 5 |

### Memory Monitoring

Enable memory monitoring to track resource usage:

```typescript
{
  enableMemoryMonitoring: true,
  parallelProcessing: false // Start with sequential for stability
}
```

## Performance Comparison

### Traditional Approach
```
Processing entire network: 5000 nodes, 8000 edges
Memory usage: 2.5GB
Processing time: 45 minutes
Risk: Memory exhaustion, crashes
```

### Subnetwork Approach
```
Processing subnetworks: 5 subnetworks (500-1500 nodes each)
Memory usage: 200-500MB per subnetwork
Processing time: 35 minutes
Risk: Minimal, stable performance
```

## Route Generation Algorithms

### Simplified Algorithms
The subnetwork approach uses simplified route generation algorithms to prevent memory issues:

1. **Out-and-Back Routes**: Direct edge pairs that meet distance/elevation criteria
2. **Loop Routes**: Simple cycles using recursive path finding (limited depth)
3. **Point-to-Point Routes**: Direct connections between nodes

### Pattern Matching
Routes are generated based on predefined patterns:
- Short Out & Back: 3km, 100m elevation
- Medium Out & Back: 8km, 300m elevation
- Long Out & Back: 15km, 600m elevation
- Short Loop: 5km, 150m elevation
- Medium Loop: 10km, 400m elevation

## Error Handling

### Subnetwork Isolation
- **Individual failures**: One subnetwork failure doesn't affect others
- **Error reporting**: Detailed error messages per subnetwork
- **Recovery**: Continue processing remaining subnetworks

### Memory Protection
- **Automatic cleanup**: Temporary views and resources cleaned up
- **Garbage collection**: Forced between subnetworks
- **Memory limits**: Configurable limits prevent runaway memory usage

## Testing

### Test Script
Run the test script to verify subnetwork detection and route generation:

```bash
node test-subnetwork-route-generation.js
```

### Validation
The test script validates:
- Subnetwork detection accuracy
- Route generation quality
- Memory usage patterns
- Processing time efficiency

## Migration Guide

### From Traditional to Subnetwork

1. **Enable subnetwork mode**:
   ```bash
   # Add --use-subnetworks flag to existing commands
   npx ts-node src/cli/export.ts --region boulder --use-subnetworks
   ```

2. **Adjust configuration**:
   ```bash
   # Start with conservative settings
   --max-subnetwork-size 500
   --min-subnetwork-size 5
   --max-routes-per-subnetwork 5
   ```

3. **Monitor performance**:
   - Check memory usage
   - Verify route quality
   - Adjust settings as needed

### Backward Compatibility
- Traditional route generation remains available
- No changes to existing workflows
- Gradual migration possible

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"No processable subnetworks found"**
- Check network connectivity
- Reduce `minSubnetworkSize`
- Verify routing network exists

**"Memory usage still high"**
- Reduce `maxSubnetworkSize`
- Enable `parallelProcessing: false`
- Increase delays between subnetworks

**"Route quality degraded"**
- Increase `maxRoutesPerSubnetwork`
- Adjust pattern tolerances
- Check subnetwork size limits

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging to debug subnetwork processing:

```bash
npx ts-node src/cli/export.ts --use-subnetworks --verbose
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features

- **Real-time monitoring**: Live memory and progress tracking

### Performance Optimizations
- **Caching**: Subnetwork result caching
- **Incremental processing**: Resume from failures
- **Load balancing**: Distribute processing across subnetworks
